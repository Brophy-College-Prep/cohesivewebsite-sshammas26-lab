         <p>Removal of Specimen 4</p>
         <p>January 19th, 2026</p>

      <div id="frontpage">
         <p class="MainText">Due to threats of legal action from an undisclosed company, we have to remove specimen #4 from our catalogue.</p>
         <p class="MainText">We have removed the ability to purchase specimen #4, and their bio will be removed by January 26th.</p>
         <p class="MainText">We are sorry that it has to go down like this, but in order to keep specimen 4, we would have to take legal action against the undisclosed company, and we simply don't have the funds to do this.</p>
